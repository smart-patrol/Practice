    The algorithm loops over the items, computing a histogram of each keyâ€™s number of times within the input collection.
    It then performs a prefix sum computation to determine, for each key, the starting position in the output array of the items having that key.
    Finally, it loops over the items again, moving each item into its sorted position in the output array.
